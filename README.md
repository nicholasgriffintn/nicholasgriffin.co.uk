# nicholasgriffin.co.uk
Repo for the Nicholas Griffin website, which I now run via the GitHub Pages, because GitHub is awesome and Pages is free, which is great for a personal site.

This site also uses Wordpress, but has been converted into a static format in order to work with GitHub, there are no posts yet, however, I plan to start using this as a place to start talking about web development.

On nicholasgriffin.co.uk you will find the personal site for Nicholas Griffin, which includes information on who Nicholas Griffin is as well as links to various projects from Nicholas Griffin.
