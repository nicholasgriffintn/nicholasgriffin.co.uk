# nicholasgriffin.co.uk
Repo for the Nicholas Griffin website, which runs using Ruby and PHP.

This repo is an exact copy of the nicholasgriffin.co.uk site and I use it to push easy updates from Github to Heroku where I currently host the site.

On nicholasgriffin.co.uk you will find the personal site for Nicholas Griffin, which includes information on who Nicholas Griffin is as well as links to various projects from Nicholas Griffin.
