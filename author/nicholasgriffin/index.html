Now, I don&#8217;t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide&#8230; and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#8217;m breaking now.

<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#8217;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

<h2>We happy?</h2>
<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#8217;s Cesar&#8217;s world, and if you&#8217;re not willing to play by his rules, then you&#8217;re gonna have to pay the price. </p>
<h2>Are you ready for the truth?</h2>
<p>The lysine contingency &#8211; it&#8217;s intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can&#8217;t manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they&#8217;re continually supplied with lysine by us, they&#8217;ll slip into a coma and die. </p>

<h3>I can do that</h3>
<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#8217;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
<h3>No man, I don&#8217;t eat pork</h3>
<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&#8217;t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide&#8230; and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#8217;m breaking now. We said we&#8217;d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&#8217;t. Nature is lethal but it doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to man. </p>
<h3>Is she dead, yes or no?</h3>
<p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I&#8217;m in a transitional period so I don&#8217;t wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can&#8217;t give you this case, it don&#8217;t belong to me. Besides, I&#8217;ve already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>
<h3>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h3>
<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&#8217;t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide&#8230; and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#8217;m breaking now. We said we&#8217;d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&#8217;t. Nature is lethal but it doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to man. </p>
<h3>We happy?</h3>
<p>Your bones don&#8217;t break, mine do. That&#8217;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don&#8217;t get sick, I do. That&#8217;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We&#8217;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
