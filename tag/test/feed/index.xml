<h2>We happy?</h2>
<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#8217;s Cesar&#8217;s world, and if you&#8217;re not willing to play by his rules, then you&#8217;re gonna have to pay the price. </p>
<h2>Are you ready for the truth?</h2>
<p>The lysine contingency &#8211; it&#8217;s intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. The animals can&#8217;t manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they&#8217;re continually supplied with lysine by us, they&#8217;ll slip into a coma and die. </p>
